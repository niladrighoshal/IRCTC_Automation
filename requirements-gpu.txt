# IMPORTANT: For GPU support, you must install the correct version of PyTorch
# that matches your system's CUDA toolkit version BEFORE installing easyocr.

# 1. Uninstall any existing CPU-only versions of torch and torchvision:
#    pip uninstall torch torchvision

# 2. Visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to find the correct pip command.
#    Select the 'Pip', 'Python', and appropriate 'CUDA' options.

# 3. For example, the command for CUDA 12.1 is:
#    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# The dependencies below will be handled by the easyocr installation.
